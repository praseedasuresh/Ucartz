        </div>
        <div class="answer ">
            <br>To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which <br>means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are<br> weatherproof, out of sight, and won't fall on your head.<br>
            <br> Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with<br> existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate<br> congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels<br>            can be added.

            <br> is 6 times faster than The Boring Company’s previous generation <br> TBM (Godot-Plus). This is still 4-5 times slower than a garden<br> snail...but Prufrock is catching up!<br>
